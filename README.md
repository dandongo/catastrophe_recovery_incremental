# catastrophe_recovery_incremental
recover from a catastrophe by doing your best vs RNG in a survival looper

Roadmap/Outline

Basics:
* Start with no food, water, shelter, or anything else you need
* use your time to collect nearby materials or to scout for materials and food, etc (similar to the way hearthstone battleground offers minions in a tavern)
* after you spend all your time, advance one day and suffer the next wave of catastrophe, taking damage for not having food or suffering exposure
* if you can survive enough waves, unlock permanent upgrades for your next loop
